# TODO

- [x] Proof-of-Concept
- [x] Better timeline headers
- [ ] Handle repeated events
- [x] Support adding Epics
- [x] Support deleting Epics
- [x] Support modifying Epics
- [ ] Support reordering Epics (drag to reorder)
- [x] Allow Epics to have a different name than the keyword
- [x] Support case insensitive keyword matching
- [x] Allow searching for specific fields (title, description, location)
- [x] Allow clicking on the name of an Epic to show & modify details
- [x] Support different colors
- Support different shades/darkness based on number of hours of events corresponding to the Epic (GitHub style)
  - [x] Support per-Epic shading
  - [ ] Support global shading (need a global color - display it instead of the color of each Epic, but don't overwrite the color of each Epic)
- [x] Support custom date ranges (and allow users to change the ranges)
- [x] Support different bucket time intervals
- [ ] Support logical "and" of keyword criteria in Epics
  - Logical "or" is already supported using "|" regex
  - Logical "and" should allow searching for different keywords for title and location (e.g. title = Dinner, location = some specific restaurant)
- [x] Make an Apply button for options so that I can enter dates freely and only check ranges during apply
- [x] Add an option to show number of hours of a bucket in the grid
- [ ] Show a preview/summary of events in Epic when a cell is clicked on
- [x] Add a column at the end showing total number of hours for this Epic
- [ ] Add option to ignore events equal to or longer than 24 hours (full-day events)
- [ ] Add option to set time zones (of time buckets)
- [ ] Allow saving and loading Epics
- [ ] Handle errors when parsing a corrupted ICS file
- [x] UI: Make timelines look like intervals rather than colored cells
- [x] UI/UX: Look into relative luminance to set foreground color based on background
- [ ] Add screenshots of the project to `README.md`
